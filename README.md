# 👋 I'm Josh. Thanks for visiting [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/josh-uk)!

## 🧑 Personal summary
Look, I get it: you don't want to spend hours reading about some guy you've only had a fleeting interaction with. I'll use bullet points to keep it brief. If that isn't good enough for you, then I think you'll just have to close this page and move on with your life: there's plenty of better things that you **could** be doing.

* I'm currently **17 years old** and will turn 18 in February 2023.
* I've been learning to program since I was about 12, but have never really settled on a language to learn. I know a little bit of **Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and C**, but don't consider myself to be fluent in any of them. At the time of writing this, I'd like to improve my skills in **Python, C and JavaScript**.
* I've been using technology since I was about 4 years old, and I'd like to pursue a career in software development after getting a degree in computer science. I'm pretty ambitious and would **love** to get a PhD, but I'll stick to aiming for a master's for now. As someone who is fairly academically inclined, I don't want to rule out aiming for a university like **[Cambridge](https://cam.ac.uk), [Harvard](https://harvard.edu) or [Stanford](https://stanford.edu)**. I'd also like to work for a **FAANG** company, and would potentially consider working abroad (e.g in the United States) or travelling as a [digital nomad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad).
* I use Reddit ([here's my profile](https://reddit.com/user/390TrainsOfficial)) a bit too much. I currently have almost **80,000 karma**, and I reckon that by the end of next year, I'll probably have more than 100,000 karma. I've used Reddit for ***almost* 5 years**. My favourite subreddits are [r/AskReddit](https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit), [r/tifu](https://reddit.com/r/tifu), [r/teenagers](https://reddit.com/r/teenagers) (which I moderate) and [r/pcmasterrace](https://reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace).
* I **built my own computer** on the 2nd of January 2021. It has an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, NVIDIA RTX 3070 Aorus Master, 16GB Corsair Vengeance RGB Pro DDR4 RAM (3200MHz), a Corsair RM650x PSU and a 2TB WD SN750 NVMe SSD. Yes, I managed to buy a GPU during the time when everyone was trying to snag them (including Ethereum miners, some of them are shitting themselves as Ethereum changed consensus mechanism from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake after 'The Merge'): I managed to get lucky on Christmas Eve.
* I also play video games. I primarily play **simulation games** (you won't catch me playing an RPG), including Microsoft Flight Simulator, Train Simulator, Train Sim World, Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator. I also occasionally play Roblox (I used to be **very active**).
* Outside of computing, I'm interested in a **pretty diverse range of things**. I like dogs, cats, photography, videography (I'd like to buy a camcorder and start up a YouTube channel where I film trains), travelling (both within the UK and abroad) and trainspotting. I also like planes and would like to **[get a PPL](https://www.caa.co.uk/general-aviation/pilot-licences/aeroplanes/private-pilot-licence-for-aeroplanes/)**. I've also been considering going on a working holiday, probably to Australia.
* I've also been learning French on [Duolingo](https://duolingo.com) since July 2022. I haven't gotten very far through the course yet, and due to personal commitments, it's likely that it'll take me a **long while** to finish it. In the future, I'd like to see if I can get myself up to [CEFR B2](http://www.delfdalf.fr/level-b2-cefr-common-european-framework-of-reference-for-languages.html) or even [CEFR C1](http://www.delfdalf.fr/level-c1-cefr-common-european-framework-of-reference-for-languages.html) level.

## 👨‍💻 What you'll find here
Well, let's be realistic. You're not going to find the work of a genius in the making here - I'm not *that* good. In addition to this page (which is technically in its own repository), I have a little repository called [learning-to-code](https://github.com/josh-uk/learning-to-code) which is exactly what the name suggests: it's where I'll post what I've been learning to do  from MOOCs and other resources (no, I won't mindlessly copy and paste code, don't panic).

> I'm currently doing [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022). I'll probably finish this at the start of 2023.
